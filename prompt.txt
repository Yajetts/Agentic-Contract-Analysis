A multi agent system that

Accepts image inputs of legal contracts (e.g., property agreements, sales contracts).
Uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract text from these images.
Parses and stores the extracted text in a structured or searchable format.
Accepts user queries related to the content of the uploaded contract.
Uses semantic search or language models to answer user questions accurately based on the extracted contract text.

Technologies to use:
pytesseract for OCR
langchain for question-answering
chromadb for text retrieval
Keep it modular: separate modules for OCR, text preprocessing, and QA

**important**
Focus on: 
Clean code with best practices
Error handling (e.g., blurry image, poor OCR)
Ability to handle multi-page scanned PDF documents 
Can read mutiple pages of a document at once


use CrewAI to construct the agents and give them detailed prompts
assign them tasks
use suitable CrewAI tools 
crewai docs https://docs.crewai.com/en/introduction
Use agent and tools to perform specific tasks 
Agents to be contructed: 
    1.Ambiguity: Detects ambiguous sentences, words or phrases that may be confusing to the reader
    and provides and explanaition as to why it is an ambiguity and what could be a 
    better way of writing that sentence/ word.

    2.framework analyser: Map and interpret governing law provisions across jurisdictions while 
    identifying potential conflicts and harmonization requirements about the topic
    
    3.Summarizer: Will summarize all the pages of the entered document, provides important details, keywords, breif explainations, etc.

    4.Deadline & Obligation Tracker: Extracts all critical dates, deliverables, deadlines 
    and obligations, like payment dates, contract time durations,etc.

these outputs listed above should only be given by the agentic framework 



For the LLM requirement, we will use OpenAI's gpt-4o model.
# Set up your .env file with the following variables:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
# OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o



For the UI: the UI is already built, its in the contract-chat-ai-assist folder.
i want you to integrate this UI into the project, the agentic system will chat with the user through the chat window, 
the user can upload the document that needs to be analysed throught the upload window at the start.
The chat bar will have buttons that the user can click that will connect to the actions of a particular agent 
(a button for ambiguity search, one for framework analysis,one for producing the summary of the document and one for finding the deadline and obligations in the doc)
you can make any necessary edits and additions to this UI code 


pdf export button - compresses results of all chats into a downloadable pdf 

document rewriter - rewrites the document with the ambiguities replaced
